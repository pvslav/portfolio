# Airflow

In this project, we will create an automated pipeline that will daily extract the current exchange rates of major currencies from an online source and load them into a PostgreSQL database table.

To implement this pipeline, we will be using the Apache Airflow platform - a powerful tool for creating, scheduling, and monitoring complex data workflows.
